## Core Features:

- Motion Detection: Detect and track vertical movements within a 3-5 cm range using the device's accelerometer.
- Real-time Feedback: Use a generative AI to provide real-time feedback during CPR compressions, such as 'Press faster' or 'Good pace', based on the detected movement rate. The AI is a tool for verbal feedback and instruction based on data.
